#Step 1 – Your Python Script
My example script was stored in the /home/pi directory and named “myscript.py”. 
Obviously your script can be called something else but keep an eye on where it is referenced
in the commands and text below.

#Step 2 – Create A Unit File
Next we will create a configuration file (aka a unit file) that tells systemd what we want it to do and when :

sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/mystartup.service

Add in the following text :

[Unit]
Description=My Script Service
After=multi-user.target
[Service]
Type=idle
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python /home/pi/startupscripts/startup.py > /home/pi/startupscripts/myscript.log 2>&1
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

The permission on the unit file needs to be set to 644 :
sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/mystartup.service

#Step 3 – Configure systemd
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable mystartup.service

Check the service after a reboot:
sudo systemctl status mystartup.service
